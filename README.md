# Mimmit koodaa intro

Simple exercises for the Mimmit Koodaa workshops. Follow this along as we go through the training.

:exclamation: This is not the ultimate guide to web development, Node.js and Express, but rather a simple exercise to help you understand a few different parts of web development. We won't be discussing syntax, semicolons, protocols, ssl, standards and other topics in detail but rather give you a "hello world on stereoids".

:white_check_mark: With this exercise we're hoping to show you how to get started, challenge you and give a boost to continue learning - this exercise is going to be challenging at times but not impossible.
